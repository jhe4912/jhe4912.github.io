		<p>Buses are very versatile vehicles. <strong>There are many different types and many different use applications.</strong> You have buses made for transporting kids to school and you have buses that run on dedicated roads separated from normal traffic. There are also many different bus manufactures. Some specifically build transit buses (Ex. <a href="https://www.gillig.com/">Gillig</a>, <a href="https://www.newflyer.com/">New Flyer</a>, and <a href="https://novabus.com/">Novabus</a>) and some specifically build school buses (Ex. <a href="https://www.blue-bird.com/">Blue Bird</a> and <a href="https://thomasbuiltbuses.com/">Thomas Built Bus</a>). There are also many different fuel types available too. For example, diesel, hydrogen fuel cell, compress natural gas and battery electric.</p>
